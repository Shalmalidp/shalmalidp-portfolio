      <p>Designing greeting cards makes you think about design, emotion and function. Any card that I designed started with “who” and “what”, who is it for and what am I trying to convey? I thought about the emotions and feelings I want to capture in the card and the message I want to communicate. It requires a balance between simplicity, design and function.</p>

      <p>Each card is like a painting; the painter creates art with a certain emotion and hopes that anyone who looks at it experiences the same emotion.</p>

      <p>I wanted to pursue this passion as a career and joined The Iron Yard, Atlanta where I spent 3 months in an immersive program that taught me front end engineering. I learned how to build simple and elegant web sites that meet the functional need and deliver an emotional experience.</p>

      <p>When I am not building websites I am trying out new ideas in the kitchen, going to my daughter's Tennis games and driving my husband crazy.</p>
